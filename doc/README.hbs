```

Tests
-----

Our test suite contains integration test cases that run this module against
real projects. For that reason, we maintain a set of git submodules in
`test/repositories`, where the actual test cases that assert their results live
in `test/e2e`.

1. Fetch all git submodules

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Set `$GITHUB_TOKEN`, to increase rate-limiting

3. Run the `test` npm script:

```sh
npm test
```

You may enable debug information by setting `DEBUG=scrutinizer*`.

Before submitting a PR, please make sure that you include tests, and that the
linter runs without any warning:

```sh
npm run lint
```

One of the most valuable things you can contribute to this project is implement
or improve plugins, which are small functions whose duty is to extract a
certain facet about the repository, like license information.

1. Create a new file in `lib/plugins`, like `myplugin.js`

2. Export a function that takes a single argument, `backend`, which contains
every function you need to interact with a git repository, like reading a file

Make sure you use the `backend` object instead of falling back to `fs` or an
API call, so the plugin works fine in both local and remote modes.

You can do whatever you need here, including checking out other branches.
`scrutinizer` will make sure the project is properly reset before calling
another plugin.

3. Add the new plugin to `BUILTIN_PLUGINS` in `lib/index.js`

4. Update test cases in `test/e2e`
